# ElecCalc

ElecCalc is a software tool for solving electrical engineering problems and analyzing circuits. It provides functionality for circuit analysis, component calculations, transient analysis, frequency analysis, and fault diagnosis.

## Features

- Circuit analysis using nodal analysis, mesh analysis, or numerical methods
- Calculation of component parameters such as voltage, current, power, impedance, etc.
- Transient analysis to simulate time-varying behavior in circuits
- Frequency domain analysis including AC analysis and impedance analysis
- Fault diagnosis to identify issues within electrical circuits

## Usage

To use ElecCalc, simply compile and run the provided source code (e.g., `eleccalc.c`) in a C compiler environment. You can customize the circuit components and configurations within the code to suit your specific requirements.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the ElecCalc repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/niladrridas/eleccalc.git`

2. Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
`gcc eleccalc.c -o eleccalc`

3. Run the compiled executable:
`./eleccalc`
